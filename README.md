## About

> JHipster is a development platform to quickly generate, develop, and deploy modern web applications and microservice architectures. We support many frontend technologies, including Angular, React, and Vue. We even have mobile app support for Ionic and React Native! On the backend, we support Spring Boot (with Java or Kotlin), Micronaut, Quarkus, Node.js, and .NET. For deployment, we embrace cloud native principles with Docker and Kubernetes. Deployment support exists for AWS, Azure, Cloud Foundry, Google Cloud Platform, Heroku, and OpenShift.

```

Build the Docker images:

```bash
docker build -t jhipster-generator-kotlin:latest .

```

Run the generator from image to generate service:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/home/phipster/app jhipster-generator-kotlin
```

Run and attach interactive shell to the generator docker container to work from inside the running container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/home/phipster/app jhipster-generator-kotlin /bin/bash
